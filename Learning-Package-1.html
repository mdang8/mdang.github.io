									<h2>Cornell University</h2>
									<p>The Computer Science program at Cornell has the major listed as a department under two different programs, <i>Computing and Information Science</i> and <i>Engineering</i>. It is part of both the <i>College of Arts and Science</i> and the <i>College of Engineering</i>.</p>
									<p>The courses that are part of the Computer Science program provide excellent resources that are available online to the public. The materials in the resources cover many fundamental topics in Computer Science and are made in a way to be relatively easy to understand. These resources can also be helpful to others that are not a part of the Computer Science program at Cornell, but are just eager to learn. Open sourcing their material aides the Computer Science community in a way that anyone interested in the discipline can easily access relevant information to guide their studies.</p>

									<h2>Harvard University</h2>
									<p>The Computer Science program at Harvard has the major listed under the <i>School of Engineering and Applied Sciences</i>. However, students will not be working with only Computer Science related material, as the program has strong connections with other majors in the sciences field.</p>
									<p>Harvard offers a great course known as <a href=https://cs50.harvard.edu/><i>CS50: Introduction to Computer Science</i></a>. This course is renowned for being one that anyone of any major can take. The course material is presented in a way that prior experience in Computer Science is not required. The goal of the course is to grow interest in the discipline and to not be restricted to people in the field only. The course is even available online and open to the public.</p>

									<h2>Northeastern University</h2>
									<p>At Northeastern University, the Computer Science program is part of its own college, the <i>College of Computer and Information Science</i>. Students of the program can choose to attain either a <i>Bachelor of Arts</i> or a <i>Bachelor of Science</i> for their degree. The difference between the two is mainly the coursework, with the latter option requiring more technical courses.</p>
									<p>Northeastern provides many resources for the students in the Computer Science program. One of these resources is a building, <i>West Village H</i>, that is central location of the Computer Science. This is where many professors have their offices and TAs hold their office hours here as well. There is a computer lab located on the first floor, which has machines that are pre-loaded with a development environment that can be used for any project or program students may need it for. Outside of the lab, the department also has its own SSH server that students can login to on their own machines to access a similar development environment. Having many resources located in one building makes working and seeking help convenient for students, while at the same time, can prove to be beneficial in creating relationships between students and professors. It is important in Computer Science discipline to work with others because solving problems in the field usually requires a collaborative effort. Creating strong relationships with peers helps make it easier to work together and make advancements in the discipline.</p>
