Hi, my name is Matt and I'm from Hudson, MA. I'm currently in my third year at Northeastern University and am working towards a bachelors in Computer Science. Previously, I was a Computer Engineering major, but switched because although it was felt like something I wanted pursue as a career, it wasn't exactly what I wanted to do and was missing something. I completed my first co-op last year as a software engineer and it was still part of the Engineering track. In that co-op, I was exposed to web development and I enjoyed doing that very much. I developed both front and back end code, so I have experience working on both the client and server side. I felt that by switching my major to Computer Science, it would best expose me to work related to this. This interest also led to me wanting to create small projects on my own outside of classwork. I am currently the Treasurer for the Vietnamese Student Association at Northeastern and along with my duties as Treasurer, I make small challenges in our weekly newsletters for our members to do for fun. These challenges are mostly all created purely on the front end, but a few of them include a back end working behind the scenes. These sort of projects are fun to me and I believe that it really defines why I chose to pursue a degree in Computer Science.
